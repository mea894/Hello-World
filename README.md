# Hello-World
Just another tepository
Trying to get close to java but seems a headache for me, sometime along the way i made a mistake cant go back and fix it, while 
trying to uninstal like diffrent of time
Apache NetBeans wont work
It's really bad for my homework
I try to fix it through daisy.github.io
I will no longer post if i fix it 
But if i cant of course i will let everybody know my frustration
